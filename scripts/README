xml zip files are named as YYYY_DDD_HH_?.zip; 

? can be "A", "D_S" or "D_N" for ascending node, descending node in SH or descending node in NH.

*YYYY*= year
*DDD* = day of the year
*HH*  = hour taken from DARDAR filename. It is time of first data contained in the file. 
	Could be different from time in time.xml
  
****xml files*****

. time.xml : time of the first measurement in the selected DARDAR scene. Format is YYYYMMDDhhmm. [UTC]

. lon_grid.xml : longitudes of the selected scene, the discontinuity at -180/180 or 0/360 is avoided. 
		 Valid values in interval [0, 360] or [-180, 180]
. lat_grid.xml : latitudes of the selected scene, [-90, 90]

. p_grid : pressure grid defined for ARTS simulations. Defined from -700m to 20000m in 250m spacing.
	   This is equivaluent to ~1100 hPa to ~50 hPa. 
	   Pressure levels [30, 20, 10, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1] hPa are also included. [Pa]

. t_field.xml : temperature field [K]

. z_field.xml : the geometric altitudes fulfilling hydrostatic equilibrium. 
		Using *pt2z* equivalent function in python. 
		Reference p0 and z0 are surface pressure (from ERA5) and surface altitudes(from topography module in typhon). [m]

. skt.xml  : skin temperature [K]
. t2m.xml  : 2m temperature [K] 

. wind_speed.xml : 10m wind speed [m/s]
. wind_direction.xml : 10m wind direction [m/s]

. iwc : IWC from DARDAR interpolated to p_grid

. z_surface.xml : surface altitudes from calculated from SRTM30 model, provided by typhon. [m]

. abs_species.xml : ["N2","O2","H2O","O3","LWC"] 

. vmr_field.xml :  VMR for species : N2, O2, H20 and O3; and LWC is provided as mass concentration [kg/m3]

. lsm.xml : land sea mask interpolated from ERA5. Land = 1 and sea = 0

. sea_ice_cover.xml : sea ice concentration, has values between [0, 1] over sea. Over land is Nan.

. snow_depth.xml : amount of snow from the snow-covered area of a grid box. 
		   No snow = 0, otherwise > 0. The value represents the depth of water, if melted snow spreads over the entire grid box.

. reflectivities.xml : Z values from DARDAR interpolated to p_grid. No filter is applied.
